## Contribution
First of all I want to thank Shawn Masterson, who created this script but abandoned it in 2018. I always used this script to figure out stuff in Veeam PowerShell when started to work with it.
To Marco Horstmann and team who brought V11 - V12 support.

If you want to enhance and improve this script please help and create issues with maybe requests for enhancement or bug reports. 
Of cause would be, when you can contribute some code of create pull requests to donate your enhancements.
