	.$ReportHasDataEmail
	ED Works with Veeam 11 and 12
	Last Updated:	11 Aug 2023 
	
	DESCRIPTION
	Only email a report if the report has data other than a blank html page.
	Experimental. 
	Tested with: 
	 "Get SureBackup Tasks with Warnings or Failures" using $showTaskWFSb and $ReportSBFailingOnly
	 "Get VMs Missing Backups" using $missingVMsEmail="SendEmailReport"

	For SureBackup or "VMs Missing" if the list has no failed VM's then don't send the email. 
	 
#>
#The default is "$ReportHasDataEmail = $false" to ignore this setting.
#$ReportHasDataEmail = $true
$ReportHasDataEmail = $false

	.$ReportSBFailingOnly
	ED Works with Veeam 11 and 12
	Last Updated:	11 Aug 2023 
	
	DESCRIPTION
	Only report a SB failed VM if that same VM never passed in the time frame.
	If your only interested in SB VM's that fail consistently over the time frame. 
	Example. Your SB jobs test VM's every week. Your time span is one month. If a VM fails every week then send email. If you have a ticketing system then this could log a ticket for you. 
	If a VM passes even once during the time span then don't send email. 
	Use with all other setting set to $false except "$showTaskWFSb = $true" and "$ReportSBFailingOnly = $true".
